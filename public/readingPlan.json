Otherwise most of the other links should work. Also, in Philippians, I see such a view from Paul about treating Christianity with such a realistic view of how it's a life and death commitment i.e. being poured out as a drink offering, Timothy risking his life to complete service that the Philippians we're lacking, Paul talking about knowing how to live in any/every circumstance, etc. Maybe it's because Paul is at the end of his life and in jail, but I found it encouraging to read through this book with the perspective of following Christ as a life and death kind of deal, not just the simple American Christian life that I'm so comfortably living.\nDevon RE Kenny: Good insight. I really enjoy Philippians; always have. I love how much Paul focuses on being joyful and living out our lives with a joyous hope in God. I think my takeaway is to be ever more joyful in my own life. I am so FREAKING blessed and have such a wonderful anchor of hope that I can't stand the thought of not being joyful!",

Another option would be a running comment log (like prayers) or we can just make it a habit of checking the previous day every day.\nLeal: I have no idea how hard the programming would be for such a feature, but an unread message icon would be pretty dope if it isn't crazy hard to do.\nDevon: Unread message counter would be cool and not too hard but part of the reason I wanted us to have a \"wrap up\" day for each book is so that we could review all previous comments and pray over them. If it's very much work I wouldn't worry to much, Kenny, about making the counter. But it's your call.\nDevon: \"Everyone who does good\"; I don't believe a non-believer can do good. They literally are incapable of doing good because they do not do so out of the Holy Spirit. in Romans 8:8 we see this backed up. From this perspective, this whole chapter and passage makes so much more sense to me.\nDevon: In Genesis we see that all men received a knowledge of good and evil the moment that Adam and Eve ate from that tree, but it doesn't mean that all men knew the specifics of the Mosaic law that God handed to the Israelites. I think that's another good reason we can give to people who ask why we don't follow the OT law. And that reason is that that law was not written on our hearts as the moral law was.\nKenny RE Devon 1: when Paul says \"glory, honor and peace to everyone who does good\" does he mean that they will be rewarded extra to what we already receive as believers?",

It was awesome, and right up my alley. The concept of Justification came up at one point in the three-hour lecture, and I learned a pretty helpful and eccentric word. The word is \"righteous-ified,\" as opposed to \"justified.\" Anytime you come across \"justified\" in Romans, it has always been easier for me to replace the word with \"righteous-ified\" instead, to represent that this concept of justification is the process of God making us righteous. What an awesome concept, guys.\n\nKenny re Josh: that is awesome! Thanks for sharing that nugget of wisdom.\n\nDevon RE Josh: I really like that. One thing I learned a while ago (not sure where) is that the word justified is kind of like saying \"Just if I'd\" never sinned. Which is to be righteous before God.",

What does it mean that apart from law, sin in dead? Why would God add a commandment if he knew the future and the fact that by doing so would only cause use greater sin? Certainly he does it so that he might show is own grace but does it not go against his own character to lead us into more sin by presenting us with the need to break the law? Or is this just the same as him testing us like we see in James? ...This hurts my brain. Addendum: I suppose it's really not that different than God placing the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden and saying, \"don't eat from this\". God could just have soon not made the freaking tree and then all would be well but then he would have no outlet to convey is infinite grace and mercy and justice and wrath and so many other attributes of himself.\nDevon: One step further: Do you think that this idea that we see of sin not being taken into account when the law is not known (John 9:41, John 15:22, Romans 5:13) plays into the age old question of \"What about the poor soul on the desert island who never even knew about the law?\"?\n\nKenny RE Devon: Those are all great questions. I think that the \"apart from the law, sin lies dead\" reference is talking about before sin was in the world, there was no law and hence sin was dead. As for your question about why would God do X if he knew it was gonna happen came up in bible study tonight. Another example is when God \"regretted\" creating man (Genesis 6:6–7). Our conclusion was that God didn't regret it in the sense that he wish that he made a mistake, but in the sense that he was sad that he had to flood the earth.\nKenny RE Devon pt2: The verses you reference are interesting. At first glance it seems that if someone never knew right vs. wrong let alone Jesus and the bible that they would be completely free of the law/sin/judgement/etc. Doesn't C.S. Lewis argue in Mere Christianity that God has to exist because we have a moral code engrained into our hearts? Also, we see in Romans 1:20 that men are without excuse, Romans 3:23 that all are without sin. Also, Drew Frazer has the infamous IBC story of how he believes that the man on the island doesn't exist. You know and understand who God is and you need to make that decision to follow him or not.",

In this verse Solomon says \"Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.\" I think that in my mind it answers that question. I think Solomon is saying that all the worry, all the anxiety, all the hurt, everything about this world that weighs so much on us is really not worth the worry.

I know tradition says Solomon, and as the wisest man alive, Solomon would make even more sense - but there's quite the speculation among scholars Christian and otherwise as to who truly wrote the book. I'm inclined to lean towards Solomon, but I'm very unsure. In one sense though, the uncertain authorship may indeed be an even higher statement to the wisdom in the book. The wisdom is not that of a certain person - not to be attributed to a time frame, or particular set of experiences. It is simply a piece of wisdom on living life as a human being. Thoughts?\n\nKenny RE Corey: I feel like the authorship of almost every book is challenged. Here are some snippets from the ESV study bible.\nArguments for Solomon\nv1: The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.\nv16: I said in my heart, “I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”\nRebuttal\n(1) The phrase “son of David” could refer to any legitimate David descendant, as it does in Matthew 1:20 with reference to Joseph and frequently throughout the NT with reference to Jesus Christ. \n(2) The distinctive nature of the Hebrew language used in the book is widely believed to be indicative of a date much later than the 10th century B.C.\n(3) The Preacher’s remarks imply a historical setting that seems in tension with the Solomonic era, such as the fact that many have preceded him as king in Jerusalem\nI suppose that in the end, it doesn't matter and that it's the bible / God's word to be trusted at the end of the day.\n\nDevon RE Corey: I think I'm of the opinion quite firmly that Solomon wrote it. Like Kenny said, just about every book in the bible is challenged in terms of the author but there are a number of statements and frankly the entire plot of the book at are far to similar to Solomon for any other author to make sense.",

With that in mind, James, as the believed leader (or at least one of them) of the council in Jerusalem would have a lot to think about when writing this.

Also, interesting perspective.\n\nJosh: RE Devon: Thought I should mention that it now widely accepted that James wrote his book sometime between 40 and 45, which is 10ish years before Nero's start to his reign.\n\nDevon RE Josh: Interesting.

Verse 17 I read \"in the context of life being short...\" we should captivate on ministry opportunities because missed ministry opportunities can be sinful.\n\nCorey: RE Devon and Kenny: To me, Verse 9 flows in the context.The previous few verses all speak about us as adulterous people - sinners and double-minded. People who have not come near to God, people who have not resisted the Devil, and have made friendship with the world. Thus, displaying a level of happiness and joy in friendship with the world. To me, it points to a self-reflection of our own sins, a recognition of how we have some up short before God, and points to the need to be humbled. I agree spot on with Kenny's assessment of judging the law.  My reading of verse 17 also fits closely with Kenny's - I see it as a warning against planning to do the right thing later, thus acquitting ourselves of the need to respond now. If we know the right thing to do, and we do not do it - for whatever reason, even saying \"I'll do that tomorrow,\" is evil. Following God is urgent, and God judges our heart.",

Why is THAT of all that he has said the most important thing?\n\nDevon: I'm always puzzled by verses like 15 where it is issued as a guarantee. How often have men and women of great faith prayed for healing that did not come about?\n\nKenny re Devon: I am not sure why it says above all. I have a friend from church who I grew up with. When he was really little his mom had cancer and his dad told him to pray and if he prayed hard enough she'll be healed. She ended up dying and it wrecked him for awhile. He's now in seminary.\n\nCorey RE Devon: In regards to verse 15, I think the definitions of the words \"powerful and effective\" must be carefully held. Particularly \"Effective.\" Effective to what end? Oh wait. Placing it in context, effective is with the context of making the sick person well. My argument just collapsed on itself. Yeah, I got nothing til I think about it more. Count me baffled. \n\nCorey RE Devon: I also sit in confusion at the line \"Above all.\" One of the common themes in James mentioned every chapter is some sort of variation on controlling the tongue - I wonder if this is, to James, the culmination of taming the tongue? 1:26 encourages a tight reign on the tongue, 2:12 encourages us to \"Speak and act...\" noting the order of speaking first, chapter 3 spends a long time talking of the tongue, chapter 4 speaks much to not slandering eachother with speech, then goes on to tell us not to boast - both our tongue's actions. Frame 5:12 with this - and I wonder if this was James's culmination of his letter. He speaks so much of our speech, and how critical our words are. Taking that into context....maybe swearing is being taken as the ultimate way of using our tongues to assert a level of control. When we swear, we imply that we ourselves have control over what happens in our lives. If our words are inevitably the overflow of what we believe in our heart - and I think James is building that point through his entire book - the summit of what he haves to say is captured in the heart condition behind swearing. A condition where we imply complete control over our lives, idolizing ourselves, and putting so much value in our own ability to fulfill our Word. So....I guess that's why I think James used the words \"Above all.\" But that may be completely off target, and I confess to a mild amount of speculation in this conclusion.",

When it says \"those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift the heavenly gift, and shave shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come\", I don't believe that it is referring to born again christians. We see many examples of God's saved by grace through faith scriptures all over the bible. My favorite one is John 10:28 \"I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.\" I think some would argue that you yourself could snatch yourself out of God's hand, but I suppose that you would have never had salvation to begin with.\n\nDevon RE Kenny: I kinda did want to skip this one just cause it's so in contrast with the rest of scripture that we could argue the point until the cows come home. Ultimately I don't see this verse doing any benefit to my faith or any other but I suppose I can offer my two cents. I think that scripture is very clear that we cannot lose our salvation by any deed or sin that we commit, and I don't see this verse going against that in any way. I have always believed that just as I had the free will to follow God (however free will and election play together for it is clear they both exist through some cosmic mystery that only God can fathom) so also I have the choice to leave him. Now you could ask why, after tasting the goodness of God and sharing in the Holy Spirit (as the verse says) I would ever want to leave and I have no clue; as far as I'm concerned you never would want to leave. But that does not mean that I CAN'T leave. This verse is so painstakingly clearly that it is talking about someone who was 100% saved that I can't ignore that. The author describes in every way, and then some, the characteristics of a true Christian (sharing in the Holy Spirit --> Only comes through faith, tasted the heavenly gift --> either salvation or the full grace of God, enlightened --> clearly conscious of their position and what is going on, tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age --> fully in touch with God and his all consuming power) and thus I MUST come to the conclusion that this verse is talking about someone walking away. It even says \"if they fall away\" suggesting their choice not God pushing them away. Whew! That was a lot!",

At one point Drew brought us back into reality when he reminded us that the psalms are poems and shouldn't be taken too literally. A tree planted in water yielding fruit is just doing what a tree is doing when it's well nourished.

Another thing that hit me today. Verse 4 says to delight in the lord, and he will give us the desires of our heart. So often, I hear verses like this read to \"justify\" using God as a genie go get what we want. Or I hear it fired back from non-Christians as to why our God is so weak and doesn't give us what we want. Butthere's a clue in the text. If we delight in the Lord....our desires change. True delight in the Lord results in a reordering of the desires - to where verse 3, dwelling in the Lords pasture, becomes our desires. Just because God is choosing not to give me an answer on marrying Jen doesn't mean that God isn't giving me the desires of my heart - rather, it points to disordered desires.

I suppose I think that boldness pays off in a lot of ways. And perhaps also that we should use our position to be influential for the Kingdom.\n\nCorey: From a thematic point of view, the boldness displayed by Esther and Mordecai make excellent case studies for application. Mix that in with what Devon mentioned above - using our positions to be influential for the kingdom. I see a call to be deeply engaged in the secular world we live in, and more than just trying to win converts - to display a different way of living. No domain of the secular world is \"too secular\" for us to engage in, and we are called to use our position in the secular world to seek the prosperity of both the Kingdom of God, and the land we reside in (Jeremiah). Also, from back in Chapter 6, I find it very curious that after the King honors Mordecai, Haman's wife/advisers tell Haman he cannot possibly stand before Mordecai because of his Jewish descent. I truly wonder what made them say that. I also find it amazing that the holiday of Purim celebrating this event is still celebrated every year by Jewish cultures.\n\nCorey: Rereading the book, I'm struck by the similar actions of Queen Vashti and Queen Esther. One doesn't come when called, one comes when not called. Both break the law. Both would be condemned by the elders on chapter 1. I'm not sure of there s mich more to take away from this than God being at work, but I find it rather fascinating.",

Mary is a virgin, a young woman, non-married and probably doesn't have much of any status in her community.\n\nAlso, how slow/fast do you guys wanna go through Luke? 1 ch/day would be just over 3 weeks long. 0.5-1 chapters a day could make the reading be 4-5 weeks long.\n\nDevon RE Corey: When I read this I see that Zechariah is doubting and questioning God out of disbelief and lack of faith. Even the way he says it seems to question God. But with Marry I don't see that; with Mary She is startled and initially doesn't seem to even understand. She is like \"What? I'm a virgin so how does that work?\" But she isn't saying \"I don't think that's possible. Can you prove it?\". And as soon as the angel explains it she is super on board and has complete faith.

He tried to convince us that Jesus wasn't perfect because he caused his parents to be stressed out when he didn't tell them where he was in this chapter. From our perspective, Jesus was being obedient to his heavenly father and as far as we know, Mary and Joseph could have been over reacting.\n\nJosh: I don't think Jesus was being disobedient to his earthly parents. Yes, they were stressed out, but that doesn't mean Jesus sinned against them. There could not have been any sin in Jesus' life for him to be a satisfactory sacrifice on the cross! Thankfully, we have enough info about THESE sorts of topics so we never have to infer about whether Jesus sinned in a particular instance or not. Find me a law in the Torah that says specifics against Jesus' actions that day. \"Honor your father and mother\" was certainly not violated here, because this command is associated with malintent of the heart. We simply see young, naturally-curious Jesus being a child, and then we see him in perfect obedience and submission upon realization of what it did to his earthly parents.",

I know that the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two edged sword, etc, but I wonder if the enemy ever uses scripture as a tactic for us to fall into something sinful. I also found this from John Piper that was an interesting quick read regarding this: https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/satans-bible-knowledge\nAlso, Verse 21 is so cool. - And he began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”\n\nDevon RE Kenny: Verse 21 is actually really cool to me. Nathan shared something in bible study the other day that I hadn't really given a lot of thought to: Basically, Jesus opens up the OT and begins reading from Isaiah 61:1,2. Now, Isaiah 61:1-2 is a prophecy for the future, and indeed Jesus is the fulfillment of that prophecy or at least MOST of it at that present time. You notice that Jesus only reads up through the beginning of 2 where it says \"to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor\" and then he stops right there! Clearly not finishing the \"verse\". That's because the second half of 2 hadn't happened it! That is still to come in the future. It's a really cool look at how God does prophecy; Just because we see one single verse talking about something doesn't mean that the things of that verse are going to happen at the same time, or even within 2000 years of each other. That means that the second half of verse 2 may not have even happened yet while the first was fulfilled over 2000 years ago! Cool stuff.",

Jesus is talking about a lamp showing the light for others - being in plain sight to light the way. So how are our eyes a lamp?\n\nDevon RE Corey: I've also wondered that myself. Doing some additional reading and taking it in context I would say this: Jesus just got done talking about lighting a lamp and letting it be seen by all; to this he is referring to his teaching and the teaching he entrusted to the apostles. So then if the metaphor for good/righteous teaching is a lamp, the metaphor for taking that teaching in and correctly applying it is the eyes and how they fill your body with light. In the KJV it says \"when thine eye is single\" meaning whole or fully complete and dedicated. So then if our eyes are truly taking in this teaching (the lamp) then our bodies will reflect that and so we will also be a light to the world and shine out that same teaching/light to those we come across. Hope that helps!\n\nKenny RE Corey/Devon: I like those thoughts. Thinking about the inverse of light was helpful for me.

This strikes me as an indicator of just how fast the pharisees has fallen - even praising God was secondary to silencing Jesus.\n\nKenny: I agree with what Corey said + The pharisees attempted to \"squelch the joy of the occasion\" (according to my esv bible's commentary). I think the pharisees were also bothered by all of the attention that Jesus was getting.",

Because of this, the only proper response to sin for an infinitely holy God is an infinite punishment, i.e. hell. This makes sense to me. To downplay our sin is to downplay God's holiness. This is typically the response I would give to someone if they asked about hell and how that is fair. Chase had a great illustration that I thought fit this: If you were to lie to me, the consequence would be that maybe I don't trust you anymore or I tell someone else you aren't trustworthy (not really all that bad of a consequence). If you lie to a federal judge, you go to jail; no \"ifs\", \"ands\", or \"buts\", you're going to jail. So then if the difference in consequence for the same transgression is that significant just between two people (both of those people broken, imperfect, beings). How much more for an infinitely holy God?!?! Again, hell makes a LOT of sense to me for it is the only proper/possible response for our God in response to our sin. If this is true, and our sin requires an infinite punishment to account for it (or else hell isn't fair if only some people go), then how is it that Christ can pay the price for our sins and not be in hell for eternity to pay for it?\n\nKenny RE Devon: That's a cool illustration. I've wondered that too about Jesus dying but not having to suffer the consequences for eternity. My short answer is: when Christ is that Jesus Death on the cross must be more painful to God than we could ever imagine.",

I expect they would have him carry it as far as he could but he literally was unable to move any farther so they grabbed someone else to go it. Also, for your second comment I totally agree. One example is actually while driving to not get angry at someone but instead to \"consider others better than yourself\" and actually think of that person as a child of God with great love. A lot of times it really pays off and I feel a real compassion for them rather than anger that they aren't good at driving lol.",

God didn't deliver us from the domain of darkness and put us into a place where we needed to earn the rest of our way into God's love or where we need to earn the forgiveness of sins. God delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.",

The High Priestly Prayer in John 17 is a really good example of that.\n\nCorey: I find that so often, prayers of thankfulness are worldly. They focus on the things and situations we have on this Earth. While not bad - I notice on John 11:41 the simplicity of \"Thank you that you have heard me\". That to me ties to us being thankful for being Gods people. He loved us before we loved him, and heard our prayers, and listens to us.

Sure, he prayed after baptism as he started his new mission. But repentance? Same thing with Mt. 26:39, I don't think Jesus \"repented\" there either because there wasn't unrighteousness to turn away from. Turning toward the will of God seems to be theme, contrary to repentance. As for the last two verses, although they don't explicitly state that they have anything to do with repentance, the concepts really spoke to me. The idea that it is God that heals us in our brokenness and restores us to life (after repentance) is comforting. It is comforting that He cares to not just listen to our confession and watch us turn from sin, but heal and give life afterwards.\n\nDevon: Yea I noticed the same thing. I think a good prayer of repentance would be David after Bathsheba in Psalm 51.\n\nKenny: I didn't do a quality assurance check on every single verse.

In general he uses the same bold policy of rebuke and correction throughout his ministry, he uses much of the same figures of speech and teaching patterns, and he generally considers his own life worth very little. However, one thing that I thought was super super cool about Paul was how he refers to himself over the course of his life. It is believed that Galatians may have been Paul's very first letter (A.D. 49 early guess) and if not his first it was an early letter (A.D. 53 late guess). In this letter he refers to himself as \"an apostle to the Gentiles\" as Peter was \"an apostle to the Jews\". Later when he wrote 1 Corinthians (A.D. 54/55), he refers to himself as \"the least of the apostles\". After this when he wrote Ephesians (A.D. 60) he refers to himself as \"the least of all God's people\". And finally, at the end of his life when he wrote 1 Timothy (likely his second last book in A.D. 63/65) he counts himself among sinners \"of whom I am the worst\". That was pretty cool to look into and see over the course of his life.",

We see elsewhere that we will be higher in position then the angels when we arrive in heaven so perhaps that is part of it.

            "comments": "Corey: Verses 25-40 discussing marriage just baffle me! They feel out of place with how the rest of scripture treats marriage. I would clearly say from the rest of scripture that marriage is Gods design - citing Genesis, Song of Soloman, and Ephesians - that marriage is Gods design. Yet, in this passage, Paul claims it is best for the unmarried to remain such. As if staying unmarried is superior to Gods design of marriage. What do you guys make of this passage? (Obviously, this passage feels extra sharp as a man who is actively preparing to transition from unmarried to married)\n\nDevon RE Corey: I mentioned to you today that I'm sure there is a bit more to this than we get to see (verse 7:1) so it's hard to say what their question to him actually was and why he is making this point. With that said, Paul explains the \"why\" of what he means very clearly here which makes me happy because so often things seem obscure and it's hard to tell what's actually being said (now we just need to figure out the context of the \"why\"). In verses 32-38 he states what he means and objectively this is true that marriage will present constraints on the Christian life that may prohibit a complete following of Christ to the ends of the earth (if that's your calling). But just like Paul says, getting married is obviously not a sin and no one would argue that it's not God's design (certainly not Paul). I think there are clearly certain advantages to marriage in our life of witness; a good example of this is Ivan and his wife throwing house parties for their block, this would be much harder to do effectively as a single person. Or take raising children, which is clearly beneficial and glorifying to the Lord. So then there is benefit to both and God is pleased with both. Certainly Paul is not arguing that marriage is a second rate institution to singleness. After reading several articles on the subject there are a number of ways you can look at this and it's hard to say which is \"exactly correct\" but I will say that it makes sense if you consider the actual gift of celibacy; In that light Paul is saying that if you do have the gift of celibacy (not exactly common) then you should try to avoid marriage because He has better plans for you in that singleness. I really like Focus on the Family and they have a pretty good article on it here: https://www.focusonthefamily.com/family-q-and-a/relationships-and-marriage/the-apostle-paul-on-marriage-and-singleness",

Close to the end of his sermon, and he was sharing some practical application for whatever money-passage we were going through, he made a bold statement on how we as Christians should give. He boldly included \"Give to your local church first.\" He also said that there is scriptural evidence to say that that should be the case. Could this passage be what he is talking about? I absolutely believe that we should give to our local church. You can find sources for that all over the place. But FIRST? What the heck. He's absolutely a Biblical pastor, and he's incredibly wise, so that really threw me. I'm wondering if I should be convicted because Kayleigh and I don't make our giving decisions with our church as our number 1 first thought.\nDevon RE Josh: That's a really interesting question. I don't think I could make a sound biblical argument for either side without a good deal more study. My gut reaction based on a simple knowledge of God and Scripture would be to say that we should give first where it is most effective or most needed. Or perhaps you might say where it will do the most good. My old church (DFC) was a fairly wealthy church and it certainly did a lot of great stuff but I remember one Easter when they put on this huge easter egg event for kids and it was cool but they bought these premade easter baskets for every single kid that attended (probably several hundred) and each basket must have been $10 to $20 bucks. And I remember being convicted about it because I thought to myself \"surely this is not the most effective way that this church can be spending $20,000\". That memory has stuck with me for a long time and whenever I think about giving I always think \"Is this really going to be put to the most effective use for the Kingdom?\". Now maybe those baskets changed some kid's lives and really was super effective; I know God can work with anything in any way he wants, small or big. So I'm really not sure when it comes right down to it; I just remember that event and I think about it a lot.\nKenny: this is slightly off topic from the original question, but I wanted to say that one thing that I really appreciate about my church is that when they preach on money, they will take the offering before the service. I've also asked Drew Frazer about this before, since he fundraises his salar, if he ever feels convicted on buying expensive things. He would say that his decision to buy something is between him and the Lord. Yeah, he may buy something totally seemingly unrelated to the gospel, but that's not for me to say what he should and shouldn't buy. I'm sure there are 100s of silly things that I've bought over the years that wasn't exactly kingdom minded. As for a church spending $20k on Easter egg baskets, I agree that it seems completely ridiculous, but if one person who was slightly more encouraged towards God's kingdom because if those baskets, then yeah I'd say it was worth it. People do appreciate excellence.",

Truly love wins far more hearts than the best \"argument\" ever will.\nJosh: well said, bro.

I've talked to a lot of people who would say \"Well, it doesn't apply because Paul was addressing a specific issue to a specific people group\" or \"Whoever was talking about something that only applied for that particular point in time because it was cultural.\" etc. That is such a dangerous way of looking at the bible because nearly everything in the Word was written for a specific purpose, to a specific people, at a specific point in time. This is what allows us to twist the word into false doctrines and terrible practices.\n\nKenny RE Devon: This is a tricky one because I stand behind verses that say things like: men shouldn't have long hair, etc. However, in verses 5 and 6 it talks about how a wife should wear a head covering when she is praying. My commentary on those verses say \"A married woman who uncovered her head in public would have brought shame to her husband. The action may have connoted sexual availability or may simply have been a sign of being unmarried. In cultures where women’s head coverings are not a sign of being married, wives do not need to cover their heads in worship, but they could obey this command by wearing some other physical symbol of being married (such as a wedding ring). While a shaven head or short hair was considered shameful for a woman in first-century Corinth, long hair was considered to be a woman’s “glory”\". For me, this commentary is relatable because I think it would be ridiculous for Aubrey to wear a head covering when she prays and it's completely understandable for her to wear her wedding ring all of the time.",

So here's what I'm aiming to do in each chapter of each book that is 3 chapters or less:\n1. Identify fulfilled prophecies in the text\n2. Identify how the text is references by New Testament authors\n3. Identify yet to be fulfilled prophecies \nThe objective I'm trying to reach here is to gain understanding of the purpose of these books, especially in tandem with the New Testament, and gain some respect for the way God operates through prophets. I realize that a good chunk of these passages may be \"Israel is doomed!!!!!!\" style prophecies - but alas, that is no reason to avoid studying them.

This reminds me of Jesus when he rebuked the sea to calm in and when you realize that this is a prophecy about God himself and his mighty power, it is no wonder the disciples were terrified and worshiped him when he did it.\n\nKenny: RE Q's 1, 2 and 3.\nQuestion #1: 1:9-15 talk about the judgement of Nineveh. We see this prophecy fulfilled in Jonah.\nQuestion #2: 1:15 and Romans 10:15 are similar because they both talk about the feet of those who bring good news.\nQuestion #3: I don't see any examples of unfulfilled prophesies here.\n\nCorey: Nice parallel Devon! I didn't pick up on that immediately - but that's an impressive parallel. I like how it connects God the Father and Christ the Son as aspects of the trinity. Kenny - I'm not so sure we see the fulfillment in Jonah. Jonah closes with a repentant Nineveh, and my commentary notes that Jonah went to Nineveh 100 years before Nahum's prophecy. Now, I know that isn't the standard of truth - and the prophecy has been fulfilled by the fact that Nineveh isn't exactly on the map anymore - but I don't know that we see the destruction of Nineveh in the scripture directly.\n\nJosh: Yeah I'm pretty sure Nahum is pretty long after the conversion at Ninevah. That's why it makes sense that God is mad enough to wipe them out in that case, because they had been a nation to follow Him, and now (during Nahum) they were not\n\nKenny: Yep, you guys are right.

I think one thing that makes a lot of sense to me is the idea that God is pure Spirit and that Spirit cannot be temptable. But Christ is unique in that he is fully man and fully God.

I personally don't think that everyone is called to adopt children but how to we carry out this verse practically in our daily or yearly lives?\nJosh: It is more acceptable to do these sorts of things as a group, rather than going by yourself to an orphanage or something. We as a Church should be caring for orphans and widows together. Therefore, I think that we can carry out this verse practically by getting involved in our local churches for these specific things. Serve/play at an orphanage with the kiddos. Serve/love widows in your church, or see if there's some sort of outreach for widows in your community.

With that said, I simply take this verse to mean that lack of mercy is a severe offense and whether in this life or the next, judgement will be given based on that. The verse before this seems to be talking about worldly forms of judgement or heavenly forms of rewards (my notes say that and I can get behind it since it talks about judgement for Christians which we know are saved through the blood of Christ).
