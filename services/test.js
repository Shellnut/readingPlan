I love it though because God's plans are unshakeable and when He decides we are going to be His instrument, we ARE going to be His instrument. Do you suppose that God did not know how the Israelites would respond to the first miracle? Do you suppose that God was a little concerned that the people wouldn't accept Him and that He would be embarrased and so that is why He gave two more signs for Moses to perform? No... This is nonsense. God didn't give Moses three signs so that Moses the Israelites would hopefullly believe at least one of them, He did it so firstly to give Moses confidence that God is a God of many wonders and secondly because these signs each represent something significant and are symbolic of something more than just a miracle."

It is a good foreshadow of Christ and the Holy Spirit.Corey: the relationship between God and Moses continues to blow my mind.

The severity of choosing to turn away God cannot be understated. Heres a question - does God more thoroughly judge and curse those Israelites who rebel and turn away, than the Pagans who were never among the inheritance? Devon: Yea these curses suck. To answer your question, yes God does judge Israel more severely than other nations who never knew him at first. We see this in a lot of places including right here in 29 (verses 19-20, 25-27). We also see it in the new testament when Paul says it would be better for a dude to have never been born than to have known God and then turned away."

In chapter 11, it says the other peoples went to war because God hardened their hearts. This tells me the Gibeonites did NOT have hard hearts, which i find curious. I am also surprised to not see God angry with Israel for that peacw treaty.Devon: Ok, so it is widely believed the Joshua wrote much of the book of Joshua (go figure). With that in mind, what we are reading very likely came from Joshua's own mouth. This is interesting because I see a number of differences between Joshua and Moses; more specifially, it seems like Joshua is more prideful. In verse 14 he says that never before or after did the Lord listen to a man which seems to me like Joshua tooting his own horn. What are your guys' thoughts\"Josh: RE: Devon: this is where it might be helpful to understand some of the Hebrew text. I didn't get any tone that denoted pride in 10:14. If I got the prideful tone from anywhere, it would be chapter 12. To paraphrase, \"Moses' two kings versus my thirty-one?!\"Kenny: RE Devon: Joshua and Moses sure had a lot of similarites (crossed water, led the israelites, etc.). I think Joshua may have had more pride, but that is because he seems to be more of a militaristic leader than Moses. Joshua and Moses also have different backgrounds. Moses was obviously rasied in Egypt and Joshua was probably raised in the desert. Moses had shyness when speaking publicly (and possibly a speach impediment), Josuha may have not had that be an issue of his leadership."

As I get closer to marriage this verse has more of an impact because it is my duty to teach my kids about the Lord. And as it so clearly shown from this passage, my kids aren't going to care unless I make some degree of effort.Kenny: Agreed. Isreal was so prone to disobedience. It's amazing that God was so gracious and loving to stick with them all of this time. I think Devon keeps saying this, but here is just another example of how the OT God is just as gracious as he is now. God has stuck with these people all the way back from complaining about mana, to worshipping cows, etc."

We see this when he hid in the camel bags, when he wouldn't lift a finger against those who spoke out against him, when he did not destroy the Amalekites because he was afraid of the people, and in multiple other places. It is also interesting and very characteristic of God to choose someone like Saul who is weak on his own but strong with the Lord's help."

When I was previously asked you guys about why God would kill every child as well as women and children, I did some research and found a web page that started by saying, \"when you are reading your Bible and you come across something that makes you uncomfortable, resist the temptation to simply move on to something else. Where the Bible makes us uncomfortable is precisely where we need to slow down. It is compelling evidence of a specific weakness. When our thoughts or feelings bristle under Godâ€™s Word, He is right and we wrong.\" With that in mind, it's pretty tempting to just move past this little summoning incedent with a witch. Doing a little more reading, I don't find it outside of God's character to use unusual means to communicate. So then, it is possible that God allowed Samuel to speak this prophacy to Saul which later came true.Corey: Soup, I totally agree that using the witch to send Samuel is well within Gods character. Who knows what it reallu looked like way back when, But it seems obvious that God used means that we today would not expect to see. I see God using a vision through a witch to send a prophesy to Saul. ---- Sauls cowardice came full circle here. In his pride, he could not die in the way that God prophesied. He had to take matters into his own hands, and die in a way that brought him one last bit of pride. I see Saul as an example of what happens to those who turn away from God"

        "comments": "Corey: Why do 3 different places credit 3 different people with \"striking down 18,000 in the Valley of Salt?\" In 2 Sam, David is mentioned to have the credit. In 1 Chron, it is Abishai. In Psalm 60, credit is awarded to Joab. Maybe Psalm 60 is referring to a different event, since it is a different count(12,000)?? I think that all 3 of these people likely participated, I'm just very confused as to why the credit is awareded differently. In a passage where the 2 Sam and 1 Chron reading was nearly word for word, this difference really stood out to me. Devon RE: Corey: I think for the 2 Sam and 1 Chron it was likely not David himself but because he was king it credits his reign with the victory. Essentially, if one of Davids generals does a thing, it is recognized as David's dynasty that achieved it even though the individual person may have been different. This is no different than an army winning and the general being given credit; we even do this today for a military victory or campaign. "

I have some ideas but I'd like to know what you think.Kenny RE: Devon: great observation devon! I agree that these types of prayers are interesting.  My thoughts are A) David has a sinful heart with these intentions. B) David sees a bigger picture to God's plan and trusts that good will be just to those who don't follow God. C) David understands that by praying that the wicked's downfall would eventually experience God's glory."

But for God, and Just and Holy God, this decision made from wrath is a response to sin. And God cannot and will not tolerate sin, He hates it and has every right to express His wrath against us because of it.Kenny RE Devon: your comment reminds me of John 2 where Jesus overturns the tables of the money changers in the temple. Jesus must have been ticked for like several hours to go out, make a whip of cords, over turn tables and pour out bags of money changers and then rebuke them!Devon RE Kenny: No kidding!"

It's easy to think that a wise man would desire humility but from 9:8 and 11:2 it is far more than that. In fact, humility is a direct application of wisdom. In other words, humility is wisdom."

I've always thought of a rebuke as a biblical correction of someone. I would feel uncomfortable calling out a non-belivers sin because everything that they do is sinful.Devon RE Kenny: Well, my verse 22:25 is much different... so without seeing the verse you are talking about I suppose that a rebuke does not at all have to be biblical. In fact, when this was written I suspect that it was not intended to be biblical. With that in mind, I would associate this verse with the notion of correcting someone who is clearly doing something negative when it would be clearly better not to. I can't think of a great example but if your unbelieving friend confided in you that he were going to rob a convenience store, you would rebuke him and show him the error of his ways."

He says 3 things are too wonderful; 4 he does not understand, then lists 4 things. What is the 3 referring to? Does it refer back? But the previous verse is negatvie things. What are the 3 wonderful things? Is it a subset of the 4? Am I overanalyzing? Corey: And who the heck is Agur, and why does his wisdom get a chapter in the bible? His name means \"The Collector,\" but this is his only mention in the bible. I am confusedCorey: Go read verse 30:1 in KJV. This chapter is just weird.Corey: And then there's King Lemuel!! Who is he? Google tells me he might be another name for Solomon, or some other king. The seemingly random but still clearly inspired nature of these two chapters is really fascinating.Devon Re Corey: I agree they are kind of weird but I'd say try not to get hung up on some of the \"weird\" things. In general, as you pointed out, there is a great deal of wisdom to be found here. As for the 3 and 4, the first three all move but fail to leave a path to follow and the 4th I suppose is simply behavioral. The weird intro in KJV has a lot to do with the morphology from those days. We see similar strange ways of wording things in many other places in the bible too."

Honestly, for me it gets a little old and I don't feel like I'm really learning a whole lot from the same old \"you will be destroyed and blown away like chaff\". There are a few things that stand out here and there but for the most part it's not terribly insightful. Thoughts?Kenny RE Devon: I agree that most of the content in these minor prophet books are pretty dry, but I also believe that some of the more popular verses from these sections are real gems: (Isaiah 1:18, Isaiah 9:6, Isaiah 6, Micah 6:8). in view of these specific chapters and as for God constantly rebuking Israel, my take away is that salvation is NOT an issue to take lightly (Isaiah 13:16 for example).

Jeremiah asks God to do some awful things to the people who keep worshipping other gods and plot against Jeremiah.Devon RE Kenny: Yea, it's crazy. I've noticed this type of stuff a TON in the old testimate. We see David praying destruction on those who oppose him and God counts David as righteous. We see it here, we see it all over, it's a crazy concept. I think the biggie here, though (or at least with David) was that he/they were zealous for God and wanted those who opposed God to be punished."

We just got done reading like 300 pages of God saying \"Women are going to eat their kids\" and now we read in Lamentations that this is actually happening. All that God said would happen because of the sin of Israel has happened and we are seeing it from the perspective of someone who is in horror at it.Devon: I also really like verse 21 that leads into the familiar 22 and 23. I love how he says, \"yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope:\" It's a wonderful reminder to us when times are hard that we still very much do have something to hope in.Kenny Re Devon: When I was reading through it I almost didn't catch the women eating their own children in 2:21 because of how bizzare it sounded. Then I thought to myself, ah, it's only poetry, can't be real. But after looking into it more, I'm amazed that this happened because of Isreal's sin. Sin is not taken lightly by God"

I mean, it's pretty much the same thing we have been reading for the past 2 months but the way it was presented here as a story shows so much more passion. It highlights the true betrayel of Israel and the unmatched love of the Father. I really liked 16 but it was a rough chapter to read because it was very vivid."

The ideas of coming before God, but not listening. Verse 33:32 stands out most - speaking against the idea that God is just happy songs, love, and has a beautiful voice. God is so much bigger than just love - but rather the source of all emotion!! We shouldn't seek church just to hear God's love and feel good, then leave it all there and go back to sinful lives. we're called to bring the gospel into every corner of our lives. "

I've actually been pondering this a lot recently and 36 just sealed the deal. I would answer that question by saying that first of all, we see in Genesis 3:17 that God literally cursed the ground because of sin. Yes, this does mean that our work and toil is more difficult but I also believe the world itself has been broken by that sin. We also see in Romans 8:22 that the \"whole\" creation has been groaning, again pointing to this idea that the physical world itself is broken and suffering and waiting to be made right. And now, in Ezekiel 36:8-9 and kinda the whole start of this chapter that God cares for the earth itself and promises to make it right once again. I could be wrong about it, sure. But wow I feel way better about answering that question to someone who would ask it. Devon: Oh yea, and then you have the beautiful second half of this chapter where God shows His infinite holiness and grace by pulling Israel back AGAIN for His own name's sake! Despite all their horrible sins and the horrific descriptions that God Himself has just used in the previous chapters to condemn Israel, He is still going to bring them back and love then without condition. And of course you have verse 36:26-27 which are just beautiful.Corey: RE Devon: Your first comment hits perfectly one of the mega themes were hitting in Gotham so far - a view of sin that looks at all creation as fallen. The Earth itself, all creation is fallen and disintegrating as a result of God not being the proper King. All creation was once good, but through sin, the entire span of creation has fallen. The effects of sin and the fall go much farther than a simple need of personal salvation - all creation must be reconciled. "

MAYBE MELCHIZEDEK?????Kenny RE Corey: MELCHIZEDEK? Don't you mean Jesus? I'm not sure who it was. Maybe it was the same angel in 6:22 \"My God sent his angel and shut the lionsâ€™ mouths\".Josh: Yeah I'm pretty sure it wasn't Melchizedek. We know that whoever it was had human form, so it could not have been a cherubim (angel). Unless I'm forgetting something, God doesn't bring back dead people to participate in His affairs, and Melchizedek has been long dead at this point. Up until this point, it has always been either the vision of a prophet, a great scene (fiery whirlwind, etc), or the angel of the Lord. That leaves only the angel of the Lord, who is well understood to be Jesus! What makes you think it might be Melchizedek? Please shed light on any ignorance that might be present on my part, my friend! Kenny Re Josh: Nice work catching up!Corey RE Josh: The Melchizedek comment was two fold. Partly a joke for Devon and Kenny to laugh at from way back in our Hebrews study in college, where Melchizedek was confusing and seemed to randomly appear. More relevant though, both this mysterious 4th figure and Melchizedek have been speculated as instances of Christophony. That is, you are likely correct in this being a pre - incarnational Christ, but Melchizedek is also speculated to be a pre - incarnational Christ. So they're both Jesus! THE ANSWER IS BOTH!!! (maybe)"

It would seem that he is talking metaphorically about a new teaching being intermixed with an old teaching, i.e. the pharisees beliefs and his \"new covenant\" and new teachings. However, this doesn't make a lot of sense in the context of the verse that comes straight before it with fasting... Thoughts?"

Jesus describes very intricately how her actions/deeds have been recieved, then simply says that her faith has saved her. This strikes me as a very practical example of the often abstract principle of our deeds being the outflow of our faith - Jesus sees her faith in her genuine deeds. The deeds aren't the final soteriological effect, but rather can only possibly represent a true saving faith. "

What are the implications of that not being forgiven? I notice that blashemying Christ IS forgiven, but not the Holy Spirit. Devon RE Corey: I have always believed that this is referring to someone refusing the Holy Spirit. When we are saved we receive the Holy Spirit (A mark of our salvation Eph 1:13-14). But to someone who was to refuse the Holy Spirit that would be to refuse the gift of salvation thereby condemning oneself to hell. Thus, the blaspheme of the Holy Spirit is the rejection of salvation which, by definition, is punishable by death.Kenny RE C+D: I've also heard that blasphemeing the Holy Spirt (and thus not being able to be forgiven) is to daily deny for the entirety of you life the gospel"

        "comments": "Devon: What are your guys' thoughts on Matthew 8:28 vs the other versions of this account in Mark and Luke where there is only one demon possessed man? People often say \"they bible has errors\" and to that my typical reply would be \"show me where\" because most of the time people are just talking out of their butt cause someone else told them it has errors. But if someone took me to this passage and the others like it, I'm not sure what my response would be. It's one thing for me to have faith and trust that the bible is true but that's a cop out when trying to explain that to someone elseCorey: Pre-google answer. first, I don't necessarily agree that it's a cop out to have faith that the bible is true in mysterious ways. Inerrantly true, even! The bible does not havr to submit itself to the views of logical worldviews; to do so would be to defend the Bible under the pretense that it is true in the bounds of a logic based view. Now, that said, I think there's more than enough room for both accounts to be true. Mark and Luke may reference only one of many men; Matthew may only mention two. if there's enough demonic power to cause thousands of pigs to kill themselves, it's fully possible this was truly a small group of men with one or two prominent leaders. Post-google answer: Seems to agree with my first answer. Luke and Mark do not indicate only one man, but rather,  \"a man\"Kenny RE C+D: I saw that too and I was wondering if I read/remembered the first account incorrecty. I think we are going to see several more occasions of these differences. If Corey, Devon and I wrote a 5 page summary on our Little, Blanca and Ellingwood trip last year, we would all bring different perspectives to the table. Some details in our writings might seemingly contradict eachother (very well because we remembered incorrectly). I trust the Bible to be true and if someone asks me about a minute difference that seems to contradict itself, I will certainly do everything I can to justify the answer to a non-believer. I personally trust that the God intentionally wrote it that way and not get hung up on something smallDevon RE K+C: Hmm, you're answer is a good answer on the pretense of faith but it dodges my question. I don't at all disagree with that but it doesn't answer how YOU would respond to someone who asked about it who was not a believer. That's what I'm driving at."

But the implication is that if we just keep praying for something than we will eventually get it. The classic response would be \"only if that thing falls within God's will\" but then what's the point of the parable at all? Why tell us something if it's not actually entirely true; but only so when God wants it to be.. but then if it's God's will it's going to happen anyways? I suppose it's a similar situation to the testing of our faith in the sense that God WANTS us to ask for things so that he can give it to us but will not do so unless we actually take the action to pray and seek it out. Corey: RE Devon: I have thoughts, not simple, still forming. will write or chat tomorrow. Kenny RE Devon: This is kind of a similar parable to the shrewd manager parable in the sense of what the heck is this and what is my take away? I found this online and it seems like a reasonable explanation: \"Assuming that Jesus doesnâ€™t mean that God is corrupt, the point must be that if persistence pays off with a corrupt human of limited power, how much more will it pay off with a just God of infinite power.\" James 4:2-3 says \"2 You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. 3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.\" Obviously James doesn't mention being in obnoxious in asking for these things, but there is probably a reality that being persistent in asking God for things does, like you say strengthen our faith.Devon RE Kenny: That's interesting. Good thought. I'll have to think about it more cause there's still some unasnwered thoughts rolling around but thanks for the reply and looking into it. That helps."

I'd like to study this chapter more. Thoughts from the crowd?Devon RE Corey: Yea I totally agree. In fact, this is one of the key places I would go to for those who believe that you must be baptized to be saved. I feel like it's the same old argument as this one was, and I think that the apostles would give the same answer as they did then; it is through Christ alone that we find salvation. (Acts 4:12)"

With that said, WHAT ON EARTH is going on with this whole thing about people not receiving the Holy Spirit when they believe? verse 19:2. I mean, what are the implications of that? Who's to say I've received the Holy Spirit or not? Who's to say you have or not? (Those last two are kind of rhetorical)Corey: RE Devon: Interesting observation!! I see it as men following a false doctrine though. When Peter asks them what they were baptised into, they claim Johns style of baptism. They seem to have missed Christ! So I'd say they were not believers until Peter came through and corrected their faith. They were even baptised a second time, and then received the Holy Spirit.Devon RE Corey: That's a good thought. If that is the case though, why do you suppose the bible itself refers to them as disciples and more importantly, believers? Also keep in mind that John's baptism was a Christian baptism; in fact, Christ himself was baptized into John's baptism. Hmm, I do like what you said, though, about them being re-baptized into Christ also... I'll have to ponder it some more."

Devon RE Corey: If we assume that Paul is talking about those whom he has shared the gospel with and \"converted\" then when those people are faced with trials they will either stand steadfast on the foundation that Paul laid or they will succumb and turn away from the faith. So then when a man escapes as through the flames (verse15) his own soul (Paul's here) is still saved but those he \"converted\" did not. The reward then is literally the reward of being the spiritual father of believers in heaven. Elsewhere Paul boasts of his heavenly reward being the people he brouth to the Lord and that also makes sense here in this verse. To think of it another way, if you were to lead Ray to the Lord, then when we face judgement and pass through the pearl gates, you will see Ray there and say \"You are my reward\"."

I think this goes in contrast to the modern day idea of PC culture and how we should never ever say anything bad about someone cause it might hurt their feelings. But often, hurting someones feelings is what they need to grow or mature. And often, as we see here, there is a usefulness to using harsh language to drive a point home when that point is of Godly necessity. Kenny RE Devon: If we were to see someone about to get hit by a truck and they weren't looking, we would do whatever it takes to yell at them to save their life. Similarly we should communicate to anyone who is not following Christ in a \"seemingly harsh\" manner to save their life"

Kenny RE Devon: I think we're all avoiding this question becase it's a hard one to answer. I don't have an answer to women's roles or anything, but this is what I found: The bible says it and it's true + Paul was addressing cultural concerns so it doesn't exactly apply to us the same way"

That said, what do you make of 2 John 10? I would say it it is referring to those who are actively spreading false teaching. As an example, Mormon missionaries knocking on my door. But how can we both love them and refuse to show them hospitality?Kenny RE Corey: That verse stuck out to me too. My understanding of it is don't let false teachers like that into your house when they are on the offense. Love and care for those kind of people when you're on more common ground.Devon RE Corey: I like what the NIV text note said so I'll read that: \"A reference to the housing and feeding of traveling teachers. The instruction does not prohibit greeting or even inviting a person into one's home for conversation. John was warning against providing food and shelter, since this would be an investment in the \"wicked work\" of false teachers and would give public approval.\""

When I realized that I also realized that I have no idea what to make of that. These exortations/rebukes are not to the \"christians\" of these places but to some \"angel\" of these places, whatever that means. A little light reading on it would indicate that these angels are messangers (either spiritual or actual humans) to be sent to these groups. It also seems that the \"churches\" here (although physical, real places in history) are actually metaphorical of certain church conditions that the Church has gone through and still is going through "
